# Battle Log Page Integration Summary

## Overview
This branch implements the complete Battle Log page UI based on the provided designs and requirements. The page displays a list of recent battles, allows filtering by victories, defeats, and game modes, and provides detailed information and actions for each battle entry.

## Key Features
- **Tabs for All, Victories, and Defeats:** Toggle between all battles, only victories, or only defeats.
- **Game Mode Filter:** Dropdown to filter battles by game mode, styled with Lucide icons and consistent with the app's color palette.
- **Battle Cards:** Each battle entry displays:
  - Game mode, map name, time since played, and match duration
  - Teams: player's team and opponents (or other players for Showdown)
  - Individual player stats: name, specialty, power level, and trophies
  - Battle stats depending on mode (e.g., Gems Collected, Goals, Safe Damage, etc.)
  - Match result (Victory, Defeat, Rank) with visually highlighted badges
  - Trophy changes (+/-)
- **Action Buttons:** Each card includes Watch Replay, Download, and Share buttons, all with Lucide icons and real interactions (modals, download, clipboard).
- **Back Button:** A fixed back button in the top-left corner for easy navigation.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to all screen sizes, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Animated Transitions:** Smooth fade-in/fade-out animations when switching tabs or filters, using framer-motion.

## Note
Since there was no predefined route for the Battle Log page, the route `/battle-log` was created to visualize and test the integration.
